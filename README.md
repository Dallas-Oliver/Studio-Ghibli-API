# Studio-Ghibli-API

this Little project I made for my first day of the #100DaysofCode challenge. my mian goal here was to learn how to use API's to display data from the internet on my onw website.
I followed a tutorial by Tania Rascia on her website https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/. this is not original work, but I feel I learned alot from doing this project. Thanks to Tania for the great tutorial!
